#Apriori Algorithm

Apriori Algorithm mines frequent itemsets(i.e occurence of items more than maxcount times)

maxcount = minsup*|D|

minsup - minimum support

|D| - number of datasets

Boolean association rules whose occurence is more than minimum confidence

confidence of association rule "A -> B" is occurence(AB)/occurence(A)
